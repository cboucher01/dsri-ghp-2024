This is the repository I created during the DSRI GHP workshop.

## Markdown
We are going over some basic Markdown syntax, such as:
- Headings
- Ordered lists
- Unordered lists

## _config.yml
We learned about setting a site title and a theme in the _config.yml file.

## index.md
I created an index.md file and added some content to it.
